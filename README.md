# WMOC class splitter

This project generates forest final start lists for WMOC according to the IOF rules. Also contains view to generate ranking points + split qualification heats based on them (and countries). And a view to generate "normal finals" (Sprint & Middle).

Rules are here: https://orienteering.sport/orienteering/competition-rules/
This version tries to take into account all rules for version v1.21. Bug reports more than welcome :-)

To run the project, ensure you have Java 17 or newer & Maven installed and run `mvn sprint-boot:run` and open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in browser.

Online version deployed temporarily to: https://wmoc-result-helper.dokku1.parttio.org (feel free to use if running).
