# WMOC class splitter

This project generates forest final start lists for WMOC according to the IOF rules. Potentially some other WMOC related special stuff added later.

Rules are here: https://orienteering.sport/orienteering/competition-rules/
This version tries to take into account all rules for version v1.21. Bug reports more than welcome :-)

To run the project, ensure you have Java 17 or newer & Maven installed and run `mvn jetty:run` and open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in browser.
